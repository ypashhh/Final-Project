    <p align="">Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually<br>
        refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software<br>
        development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop<br>
        browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has<br>
        become ever-increasingly important</p>
